Welcome to the EV3 Line Tracing workshop by EIG.  
This is the codebase that contains all the files that we will use in the Workshop.  
## Step 1: Download EV3 Classroom App
Download the App through this link:  
https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software/  
Download the files and open the launcher.
## Step 2: Download All the files in the Lesson files
Download all the files in [Lesson files](./Lesson%20Files/)  
OR  
Download the entire repositry as a zip file and unzip it.
## Step 3: lesson 1 and 2
Open the Files downloaded  
Follow the Lesson pace and slides.
## Step 4: Lesson 3 - 7  
These Lessons are to be done at your own pace.
After each lesson, notify one of us and we will ensure that you have done the exercise correctly


# Competition Rules
After completing all 7 lessons, you are able to continue to this section  
You may make your own modification to your robot and complete your code in prepareration for the competition  
The Goal of this competition is to reach either end zone while completing objectives along the way.  
The Map for the Competition is as follows:  
![Map for EV3 Line Tracing Competition](./Map.png/)
## Zone and Indicators Descriptions

| Zone                | Condition for Validity                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start Zones 1 and 2 | Robot must be fully within the start zone before beginning          |
| End Zones 1 and 2   | All bricks must be fully inside the green zone for points, Robot has to be 50% in the End zone for it to count |
| Colored Bricks      | Placed in the same location after each try, per competition map     |
| Colored Indicators  | Unlabeled colored squares on the map, their use is up to the individual teams to interpret and decide|
| Barrier             | Physical barrier; collision results in a restart                    |
| Black Box           | Rectangular box marked with black tape or paper                     |

## Notes For Map
- **Barriers**: These are the only physical barriers on the map.
- **All other indicators on the map** are purely **2D** and **are to be used to help your robot navigate through the map**

## Scoring Breakdown
| Task                          | Points if within 4 minutes | Points if within 2 minutes |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Reaching and Stopping Within End Goal 1          | 5                          | 15                         |
| Reaching and Stopping Within End Goal 2          | 10                         | 35                         |

## Bringing Colored Debris/Bricks to the End Zone
| Brick Color | Number on Map | Points per Brick |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Red         | 3            | 5               |
| Blue        | 2            | 2               |
| Black       | 1            | -5 (if touched) |

### Deviating from Line Without Indication (e.g., Hard Coding Without Clear Signals)
- Restart the robot on the next try.
- No points would be awarded for the current attempt.
---

## Point Allocation Notes
- **End Zone Requirement:** At least 50% of the robot must be stopped within the end zone for points to be awarded.
- **Brick Placement:** Colored bricks must be fully in the end zone for points to be awarded.
- **Track Rules:** The robot is not allowed to re-enter a section of the track it has already crossed. Doing so will result in **automatic disqualification**.
- **Time Limit:** If the robot does not reach the end zone within **5 minutes**, the attempt is disqualified.
- **Attempts Allowed:** Each team is given a maximum of **2 tries**. The higher scoring attempt will be recorded.
- **End Zone**: Once the robot stops in a endzone, **the run is considered to have ended**.

**Ensure all rules are clearly understood before the competition begins. Good luck!**
