# Competition Rules
After completing all 7 lessons, you are able to continue to this section

The Goal of this competition is to reach either end zone while completing objectives along the way.  
The map for the competition is as follows:

## Point Allocation Notes
- **End Zone Requirement:** At least 50% of the robot must be stopped within the end zone for points to be awarded.
- **Brick Placement:** Colored bricks must be fully in the end zone for points to be awarded.
- **Track Rules:** The robot is not allowed to re-enter a section of the track it has already crossed. Doing so will result in **automatic disqualification**.
- **Time Limit:** If the robot does not reach the end zone within **5 minutes**, the attempt is disqualified.
- **Attempts Allowed:** Each team is given a maximum of **2 tries**. The higher scoring attempt will be recorded.
- **End Zone**: Once the robot stops in a endzone, **the run is considered to have ended**.

**Ensure all rules are clearly understood before the competition begins. Good luck!**

## Enjoy and Have Fun!
